Bazar.ba is envisioned as an e-commerce web application, that provides a platform for small businesses and creators to sell their products and manage orders free of charge. 

This application is a part of my Bachelor graduation project and will be developed using Spring Boot and React, with a PostgreSQL database.

Live version is available [here](http://bazar-ba.herokuapp.com) <br>
API documentation is available [here](https://bazar-ba-server.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html) 

Run app locally by executing `docker-compose up` in the terminal
